# Introduction
This programming manual serves as an open source database on programming languages. The database details information regarding the language's origins, applications, downsides, statistics, and more. Due to the open source nature of this project, we are open to edits that add more languages, improve accessibility, and refine existing content. As more languages establish, the website will update accordingly to keep up with current trends in programming. Our manual intends to help those who may not be sure what language would best suit their needs as well as introduce programmers to other languages they have yet to learn.

# Guidelines to Contributing
The following are the rules to abide by when creating and adding onto new language pages(This list may be updated in the future):
1. Use the "example.md" in the pages folder on the Github repository as a guide to orienting information.

3. Cite where information contributing to the site was taken from.
4. All information must be accurate and traceable. 
5. All code must compile and run properly.
6. Text content must follow standard grammatical conventions.
7. Words must all be correctly spelled.
