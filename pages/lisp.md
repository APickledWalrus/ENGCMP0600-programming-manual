### Brief History
Lisp is a programming language invented in the 1960 by John McCarthy. Scheme is noteable for it's involvement in early artifical intellegence research and very distinve sytnax. There are many variants of Lisp todays, such as Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure.

### Applications/Use-cases
The syntax of Lisp is heavily inspired by lambda calculus. It is noticebly different from other
programming languages and sometimes jokingly called parentheses hell.

An important concept of Lisp is the S-expression. All programs, datastrutres are writted as S-expressions.

Unlike other language all operators in Lisp use postfix notations (also sometimes called polish notation).
For example `1+2` would be written as `(+ 1 2 )`
