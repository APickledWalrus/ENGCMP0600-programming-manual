# Ruby
Developed by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto in the 1990s, Ruby’s first version officially released on December 25th, 1996. As an open-source object-oriented scripting language, everything in Ruby is an object except for blocks. Ruby was built in mind to smoothly connect human programmers to computers. Since Ruby is an interpreted scripting language, code can execute without the need to compile.

# Nerd Stuff
Web development is a common use for Ruby. With the Ruby on Rails(aka RoR or Rails) framework which extended Ruby language, web development changed and became much more efficient. RoR uses code generators to create parts of web applications without needing to write code. The writing conventions define conventions shaping the frameworks of apps. Such qualities make it easier to construct large applications without requiring large developer teams.

The first static site generator, Jekyll is written with Ruby. Static site generators deploy pages to a server after generating every page at once. Typically websites that utilize such generators don’t contain content frequently altering. A user visiting a URL is provided with a static HTML file.

While web applications can be quickly developed with Ruby, the actual performance of the applications are not always as fast. The weight slowing Ruby down comes from database connections and the written code’s framework. 

Due to its operations on strict standards and paradigms, there’s a lack of flexibility with changing the core codebase. Several of the objects already pre-configured as well as default code samples are not editable. 

While you can write code while running the program, debugging and tracing errors is difficult and primitive. There's no method to get a true list of what problems there are with code that won’t properly run. Anything errors that are found during runtime will have to be traced or mapped back to the static code to figure out where it originates. Changes would have to be made until the runtime changes to the desired output.

# Ecosystem
RubyGems, Ruby’s default package manager, assists users with downloading, packaging, and distributing libraries, binaries, and applications. Application collections are known as Gems which can be collections of code, lists of meta-data, libraries, and dependencies. Ruby can also be connected to MySQL, Oracle, DB2, and Sybase. API documentation and guides for ruby can be found on [Ruby API Link](ruby-doc.org).

# Examples
The following is an example of a "Hello World!" program in Ruby.
```
puts “Hello, World!”
```

# Stats
- The most used versions of Ruby are Ruby 2.7 and Ruby 2.6.
- The most used version of Rails(RoR) is Rails 6.0.
- The most common type of software developed with Ruby are websites.
