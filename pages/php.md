# PHP

Originally abbreviated for Personal Home Page, now standing for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, PHP officially released on June 8, 1995. PHP was designed by Rasmus Lerdorf with its developers consisting of The PHP Development Team, Zend Technologies, and PHP Foundation. Embedded within HTML, the language is an open-source server side scripting language. The language itself was not designed at first to be a language but had developed and grown to be one.

# Nerd stuff
Designing web applications demands several features to create an effective product. PHP utilizes a three-layer structure that works linearly on browser, server, and database systems. The three-layer system allows users to manage such features like customization, interactive UI, online transactions, and database integration. Some mechanisms are also built in for user authentication integration, SQL query builder, routing, and CSRF protection. PHP works to construct both static as well as dynamic pages/applications. 

Image manipulation is another popular use of PHP as integrating a library with an application offers cropping, rotating, resizing, creating thumbnail photos, watermark creation, and output image generation is a wide variety of formats(ie. jpeg, wbmp, xpm, png, gif). When paired with graphing tools, the language also allows data representation creation such as scatterplots, graphs, and charts.

Since PHP lacks strict restrictions for its code, syntax for PHP can get unpredictable and inconsistent regarding naming functions. There is freedom with writing parameter order and function names can be done in different conventions. The lack of restrictions, in turn, creates bad quality code. Inconsistent documentation makes it difficult to understand what code is good and what is bad. Experience is needed to be able to write good code and handle all the inconsistencies. 

Due to the open-source nature of the language code vulnerabilities can be easily discovered and shared. Security problems can be exploited from side attacks like SQL injections before issues can get patched up. PHP can also be vulnerable to cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, session hijacking, and authentication bypass.

# Ecosystem
Packagist is PHP’s main package repository as well as a package manager along with Composer. PHP is also integrated with several popular databases such as PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, MySQL, MS Access and Microsoft SQL Server. There are many PHP libraries out available but the Standard PHP Library(SPL) is one that offers interfaces and classes for common problems. SPL can be found at www.php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php. The language can also integrate with many image processing libraries like ImageMagick, Imagine, and GD Library.
