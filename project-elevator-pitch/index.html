<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to my Elevator Pitch Generator web design tool, powered by Stasis Theory. I'm glad you found it--we're going to adapt a 2,000 year old formula to help you pitch an idea, explaining who you are and what you want, why it's important, and what it will do for your audience. I use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about rhetoric, and a little bit about computer science. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you will make a really cool web documemt that helps pitch your idea and learn a little bit about coding.

You could make web presentations the easy way by creating a pdf's or powerpoint, or you could do a little more work to better understand these digital tools that you use everyday to (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand our tools and how they work.

In this file, you will work through the four questions of stasis: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. This method is tried and true, 100% guaranteed to help you say something meaningful about almost anything. While the Greeks originally used it to help them explore questions and issues, and to try to figure out where others might disagree on those issues, the design can easily be adapted to other ends like this one. You should even commit this exercise of stasis to memory. That way, if you are ever stuck on an elevator with someone important...you'll be ready to have something to say. That was indeed the problem for Archimedes, the engineer who built the first elevator in 236BC and afterwards found himself riding in his elevator with all kinds of powerful people, ascending and descending with nothing to say. And for almost two hundred years, the the problem continued to plague the Greeks until the rhetorician Hermagoras solved this communication problem by developing the questions of stasis. Some say it was actually Aristotle, some hundred years pre-elevator, who first theorized the questions of stasis. And much later in the Roman period, Cicero, Quintillian, and Hermogenes added their own iterations.

I like to think about stasis theory in terms of space. Some say the goal of this exercise is stasis, or agreement with the other, but I would argue that the goal of stasis is actually movement. Yes, when we come to stasis, we stop. But we stop only long enough in time/space to assess how we got where we are and what happened before moving forward. I argue that we actually use stasis theory to ready ourselves and others to move with changed velocity (in a new direction and perhaps at a different speed.)

To get started with the Elevator Pitch Generator, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file. Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images and pdf's, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our stasis theory web document.

If you are working in groups on GitHub, one group member will need to fork the website in GitHub and then each group members should fork from this new repository.

BTW. You can leave these faded comments be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

You don't need to do anything in this html. code, but you'll need to change the background image on the style.css page. First replace the el1.jpg with a .jpg or .png in the project folder (hint: simplify the name).

<!--in this next section you need to answer the first question of stasis, that of conjecture. What is the problem? Can it be solved?-->


<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Conjecture</h2>
    <h3>Today, there are many programming languages, each with their own distinct features and purpose. Oftentimes, this can be intimidating for new programmers, and even experienced ones who are trying to determine how they should develop their project. This project will unravel and combat this problem by offering a go-to manual for comparing, contrasting, and offering recommendations for programming languages through a standardized template.</h3>

<!--You can't break this thing! Right? Control Z. Comtrol Z. Control Z...-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
    <h2>Definition</h2>

    <h3>A manual that briefly describes each language, but more importantly displays the important strengths, weaknesses, characteristics, and ecosystem of each programming language. A primary goal of this project is developing a standardized and well-organized template that can contain and display this information. By using a template, we enable ourselves to create a feature that allows users to easily compare languages. 
      
      Our development process consisted of us dividing tasks into content writing and website development. Everyone was assigned to write two languages pages to work on with some additionally working on the GitHub repository and or website structure. We held meetings during each week as well as project checks to establish what is done. what needs to be done, and who does what. </h3>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Quality</h2>
     <h3>We believe this issue is especially important because of the audience. Programming is a large and inherently confusing topic, which can be extremely daunting for beginners. In some cases, it dissuades them from engaging with something they may end up loving. While a lot of this information is already on the internet, it is scoured across the internet meaning a time investment is required by users. By aggregating all of this information within an organized manual, we can create a convenient location for users to quickly find what they are looking for. The fact that information is standardized greatly simplifies the “research effort” to be undertaken by users, which is why we believe this tool will be effective. To ensure the viability of this proposal, this will need to be a continuous long-term project if it wants to not fall out of date. Thus, it is the ideal candidate for an open-source project, where anyone is welcome to contribute to or continue the project at any time. Our solution is effective in solving this problem because it not only provides a standardized form for comparing information, but its open-source nature and planned design will enable the project to grow forever. </h3>

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Moving Forward</h2>

    <h3>While there are several languages available on the page right now, we intend to add on more and develop the existing pages. With more information being written, the template in turn will also evolve to better classify different sections and subsections of information. As more languages are added to the website, users would have to sift through more. Therefore we also intend to add a survey to the website that users can fill out such that languages can be suggested to them to best suit whatever needs they have. Lastly, we plan to make edits to the overall appearance of the website later on to ease navigation between different language pages. The appearance changes will also consist of integration for viewing on a mobile platform.
